    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "DGL is designed to bring machine learning closer to graph-structured data. Specifically DGL enables trouble-free implementation of graph neural network (GNN) model family. Unlike PyTorch or TensorFlow, DGL provides friendly APIs to perform the fundamental operations in GNNs such as message passing and reduction. Through DGL, we hope to benefit both researchers trying out new ideas and engineers in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate the basics of DGL including:\n",
    "- How to create a graph?\n",
    "- How to manipulate node/edge features on a graph?\n",
    "- How to convert a graph to/from other formats?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this tutorial uses [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) as backend for tensor-related computations (thus some familiarity with PyTorch is preferred), DGL is designed to be platform-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other frameworks like [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and we are actively working on this."
